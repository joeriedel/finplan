# finplan

finplan is a personal financial planner for one user. It is a Linux desktop app written in Go, drawing its UI with Dear ImGui and ImPlot (via cimgui-go) on SDL3, as a native Wayland client. It shows a tabbed application shell with a working Graph tab and the first half of the Projections tab over the record in its database (an invented family record with `--demo`); the other tabs are placeholders. The UI uses a dark theme and the bundled Inter font.

The data model, projection engine and planned features are described in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md). The model and a placeholder engine exist as standalone Go packages, `internal/model` and `internal/engine` and the Graph tab draws from them. A storage layer, `internal/store`, saves and loads the record to SQLite, and the app uses it.

## Prerequisites

- podman, used to build and test inside a Fedora 43 container (no Go toolchain is needed on the host)
- SDL3 on the host (`libSDL3.so.0`, Fedora package `SDL3`) to run the app

## Build

    scripts/build.sh

This builds the container image on first use (and whenever the `Containerfile` changes) and produces `bin/finplan`.

## Test

    scripts/test.sh

Runs a gofmt check, `go vet` and `go test` in the container.

## Run

    bin/finplan [--demo]

With `--demo` the app runs against a temporary database seeded from the invented family data and the family view presets; it is removed on exit and the window title is "finplan (demo)". Without it the app uses `$XDG_DATA_HOME/finplan/finplan.db` (only when `XDG_DATA_HOME` is an absolute path) or else `~/.local/share/finplan/finplan.db`; the folder is created with mode 0700. An empty database shows a hint on the Graph tab.

File > Backup... opens a save dialog (`.db` filter, default name `finplan-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.db`) and writes a consistent copy of the database. It refuses to overwrite the open database itself.

Drag to pan and scroll to zoom the plot. The toolbar has a Projection dropdown and range buttons (1Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y, All). In the line list, checkboxes toggle a line, the S button solos it (only soloed lines are drawn; a "Solo: N · Clear" chip or Ctrl-click on any S button clears all solos, and the checkboxes are left as they were), "+ Add" adds one, and rows can be pinned to a projection, recoloured and removed. The Bands section shades the gap between two lines (optionally hatched, with the gap at the cursor in the tooltip, also in today's dollars), and the View preset section saves and restores the lines, bands and date range (presets are saved in the database and persist across runs; the demo database holds two example presets). Changes made to the database by another process are picked up: the app checks the database's data version once a second and reloads when it changes. Click a line, its row or its data lane under the plot to select it, and hover over the plot for the crosshair and tooltip, with value tags in the y-axis gutter and the date tag below the plot.

The Projections tab lists the projections as a tree with Reality first, with search, New, Clone, Rename and Delete, and edits a projection's parent, start date, override history, inflation and modifications (add, remove, edit a constant value or start, drag to reorder; modifications overwritten by later ones are greyed with a tooltip). Edits are saved to the database at once. Edit > Undo and Redo (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y) step through them until the database is reloaded. Modifications with several segments and budget item additions are shown but not yet editable.
