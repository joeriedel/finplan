# finplan

finplan is a personal financial planner for one user. It is a Linux desktop app written in Go, drawing its UI with Dear ImGui and ImPlot (via cimgui-go) on SDL3, as a native Wayland client. It shows a tabbed application shell with a working Graph tab over an invented family record; the other tabs are placeholders. The UI uses a dark theme and the bundled Inter font.

The data model, projection engine and planned features are described in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md). The model and a placeholder engine exist as standalone Go packages, `internal/model` and `internal/engine` and the Graph tab draws from them. A storage layer, `internal/store`, saves and loads the record to SQLite; the app is not wired to it yet.

## Prerequisites

- podman, used to build and test inside a Fedora 43 container (no Go toolchain is needed on the host)
- SDL3 on the host (`libSDL3.so.0`, Fedora package `SDL3`) to run the app

## Build

    scripts/build.sh

This builds the container image on first use (and whenever the `Containerfile` changes) and produces `bin/finplan`.

## Test

    scripts/test.sh

Runs a gofmt check, `go vet` and `go test` in the container.

## Run

    bin/finplan

Drag to pan and scroll to zoom the plot. The toolbar has a Projection dropdown and range buttons (1Y, 5Y, 10Y, 30Y, All). In the line list, checkboxes toggle a line, the S button solos it (only soloed lines are drawn; a "Solo: N · Clear" chip or Ctrl-click on any S button clears all solos, and the checkboxes are left as they were), "+ Add" adds one, and rows can be pinned to a projection, recoloured and removed. The Bands section shades the gap between two lines (optionally hatched, with the gap at the cursor in the tooltip, also in today's dollars), and the View preset section saves and restores the lines, bands and date range (presets are kept in memory only for now, since the app does not use the store yet, and two example presets ship with the app). Click a line, its row or its data lane under the plot to select it, and hover over the plot for the crosshair and tooltip, with value tags in the y-axis gutter and the date tag below the plot.

## Fonts

The Inter font is bundled under the SIL Open Font License; the licence text is in `cmd/finplan/fonts/OFL.txt`.
